I have only had a few minutes of browsing through the landing page but I am already intrigued by the vertical & the problem.

Few things I have understood about Tab;

- Tab is tackling a very unique vertical that lies between payments infrastructure and the travel sectors.
- Like most other travellers, I have personally experienced the friction that lies in payments overseas especially non US/UK/EU countries. 
- Tab is the only company i have encountered going after this problem, which means we could have opportunities to explore more products such as market vendor payment infrastructure for travellers[ for instance ; reducing the friction of payments in turkish or morrocan market towns,etc]


My Porftolio Career so far: 

- I got into tech in my mid-20s, discovering the startup world as a SEIS business development executive; I went back to uni this time focused on AI and transitioned my career with a sense of urgency and purpose to be inside the arena building. 
- Every decision I have taken within the last 5 years has been to optimise my skillset for early stage startups, instead of going fulltime with skyscanner , I drafted a career trajectory that will provide me more depth in experience of building products from zero-to-one.
- Most recently I built my own Ai first product called Caddie AI- A Golf Coaching app that leveraged discriminative & generative ai; I built the backend,frontend, the models, the dataset and the remote teams to get the product deployed.
- I believe I bring skills that aren't learnt in Big Brand CVs.
- I Look forward to having a chat about the Vision of Tab and how I could possibly add value. 

Thanks,
